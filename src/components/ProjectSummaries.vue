At Populum the goal was to make intricate data visualization intuitive. While working toward this my focus was to also make graphs come alive through animations and interactive hover functionality while also retaining Populum's sleek professional design language. As intuitiveness always was the primary goal, animations were always included to improve this quality and not take away from it.",

I chose one primary color beside a shade of black and white and purposely chose Times New Roman as body text for its stripped down character to contrast the bold heading font. I worked a lot with overlapping and offset elements to make the otherwise simple layout to something more than the sum of its parts. This project never took off but the client was surprised how the mockups hit the nail on its head given how little visual context they had given.",
